# My Personal Project: A Financial Management Tool

## About the Application
This purpose of this application is to track one's *budget* and manage one's *finances*. Specifically, the application 
will allow its user to create a new account and add it to a list of accounts. The user will then be able to view the 
list of all accounts in the application and there total **account balance**. The user will also be able to select an 
account and remove it from the list of all accounts in the application. Furthermore, the user will have an option to 
make transactions (credits/debts) to a certain account which updates their account balance.

This application will help serve students attending school, working adults, or even the senior population. Many of us 
are occupied with several tasks and responsibilities on a daily basis, such that it becomes challenging to keep track of
everything, including our finances. This application will help serve such people by helping keep record of their daily 
transactions and account balance. Furthermore, many people have **multiple accounts** in various financial institution; 
another added benefit of this application is that it will allow them to view their transaction records and account 
balances from various financial institutions in a collective manner - something previous applications miss out on. Most 
importantly, this project is of interest to me as it will help promote *financial literacy* and *financial security* for
the public as they will be able to view their daily transactions and account balance in an **accessible 
manner**, and it will allow them to form budgeting strategies around that information. As a student occupied with 
several responsibilities and tasks, I understand how difficult, yet how important it is to keep track of such 
information, which is what motivates me to create this application.
