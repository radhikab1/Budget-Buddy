# My Personal Project: A Budget Tracking Tool

## About the Application
This purpose of this application is to track one's *budget* and manage one's *finances*. Specifically, the application 
will allow its user to create a new account and add it to a list of accounts. The user will be able to view the list of 
all accounts in the application. Furthermore, the user will be able to add transactions (credits/debts) to a certain 
account, including the **date** the transaction occurred, the **value** of the transaction, and the **category** the 
transaction falls under (a description of the type of transaction). Then, the user will be able to view there total 
**account balance** and access **transaction records** given a specific date.

This application will help serve students attending school, working adults, or even the senior population. Many of us 
are occupied with several tasks and responsibilities on a daily basis, such that it becomes challenging to keep track of
everything, including our finances. This application will help serve such people by helping keep record of their daily 
transactions and account balance. Furthermore, many people have **multiple accounts** in various financial institution; 
another added benefit of this application is that it will allow them to view their transaction records and account 
balances from various financial institutions in a collective manner - something previous applications miss out on. Most 
importantly, this project is of interest to me as it will help promote *financial literacy* and *financial security* for
the general public as they will be able to view their daily transactions and account balance in an **accessible 
manner**, and it will allow them to form budgeting strategies around that information. As a student occupied with 
several responsibilities and tasks, I understand how difficult, yet how important it is to keep track of such 
information, which is what motivates me to create this application.
